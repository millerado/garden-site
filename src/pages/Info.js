      <h2>Garden Organization</h2>
      <p>
        The Ranch Community Garden is an all volunteer community endeavor, and
        we rely on the help of all our members to keep the garden in good shape.
        We have a Board which consists of 4 to 6 volunteers to organize,
        communicate, and work with members to follow guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each garden member is aske to volunteer 10 hours of time to garden
        activities each year. This may consist of: weeding and harvesting Food
        Bank plots, helping with infrastructure building, spreading mulch, or
        even helping new gardeners figure out the craft. If you have any
        questions please email coloradogardens@gmail.com or a member of the RCG
        Board.
